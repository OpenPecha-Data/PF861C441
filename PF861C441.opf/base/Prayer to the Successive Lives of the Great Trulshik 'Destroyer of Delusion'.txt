Prayer to the Successive Lives of the Great Trulshik 'Destroyer of Delusion'
by Ngawang Tenzin Norbu

om ah hung
Oṃ āḥ hūṃ
changlo chen du tutob sangwé dak
In Aṭakāvatī, you were the mighty Lord of Secrets,
tönpé dü su nyené küngawo
During the Buddha's time, you were his attendant Ānanda;
song tsen dü su chölön gar tong tsen
In Songtsen Gampo's day, you were the Dharma minister Gar Tongtsen;
orgyen dü su bai ro tsa na dang
In Padmasambhava's time, you were Vairotsana;
dik gyal dul chir lha lung pal dorjé
And, to tame the wicked king, Lhalung Palgyi Dorje;
mi lé dü su ré chung dorjé drak
During Milarepa's time, you were Rechung Dorje Drak;
sangdak kabab lé kyi dorjé shyab
And you were Lekyi Dorje, who held Vajrapāṇi's transmission;
lho drak kharchur melong dorjé dang
You were Melong Dorje of Lhodrak Kharchu,
wenné shya dé'ur trulshyik kün sö sok
And in the hermitage of Shade'u, Trulshik Kunsö—
chikdü khorlö gönpo ja tangpa
Embodiment of them all, lord of the maṇḍala, who renounced ordinary activity,
kunzang tongdrol dorjér solwa deb
Kunzang Tongdrol Dorje, to you I pray!
